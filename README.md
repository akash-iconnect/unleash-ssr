- add your configs in _app.js and index.js
- add flag in index.js line 10
- run using npm run dev
- go to http://localhost:3000/
- check logs in browser, you can see flagReady as false then it becomes true, but variants are already present
- you can also view page source and check that "Loading Component" is delivered from server side and not "Component to show after flag ready"
